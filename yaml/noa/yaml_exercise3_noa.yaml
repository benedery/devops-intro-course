howtomake:
  step1: >- In a small pot, simmer *ingredients1 until sugar completely dissolves,
    about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat. In a separate bowl, whisk &ingredients2. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk
    about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream.
    Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
    (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).
  step2: >- Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature. Cover and chill at
    least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturers’ instructions.
    Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.

  ing: *ing2 *ing3
step 4:
  howTo: <
    Maintain a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover the pot with a tight fitting lid, and maintain a gentle simmer.
  ing:  *ing2 *ing3
step 5:
  howTo: <
    Cook without peeking or stirring. Cook until the water is absorbed, about 18 minutes. Try not to peek until the end of the cooking time so the steam doesn't escape. Whatever you do, don't mix the rice while it's cooking â€” this will lead to gummy rice.
  ing: *ing1 *ing2 *ing3
step 6:
  howTo: <
    Let the rice rest covered. Turn off the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 10 minutes. During this time, the rice will steam for extra fluffy results.

    Fluff the rice with a fork.
